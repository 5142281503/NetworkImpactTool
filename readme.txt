Network Impact Tool (NIT tool). Used to measure the added overhead of software on your PC's networking speed.

I do not know of any other tool which can measure the real impact of software, to this granularity.

This tool allows you to:

- Edit a text file with a list of domains the tool will use
- Will eliminate the DNS lookup from thr equation
- Use the real IE engine to actually load the web page

You can use this tool to measure differences:

- the overall response at different times of the week/day
- the differences in response time when used from differing ISPs
- or the differences in response time when used in different countries, etc..
